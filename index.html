        Is serving as the third entry in the Fast & Furious franchise, it departs from the previous installments by
        focusing on street racing culture in Japan. The story follows Sean Boswell, a troubled teenager sent to Tokyo to
        avoid jail time in the United States, where he becomes immersed in the underground world of drift racing. The
        film highlights Japanese car culture, stylized racing sequences, and themes of rivalry, loyalty, and redemption.
        Though initially a standalone story, it later became a key link in the series overarching timeline, introducing
        the fan-favorite character Han Lue.
